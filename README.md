- SQLite persistence

## Use Cases

- Small self-hosted demo app

## Development

Run the local verification checks before opening a pull request:

```sh
python3 -m py_compile server.py
node --check public/app.js
node --check public/config.js
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

## Real Integrations

The app stores user-created data locally in SQLite and does not upload records to external services.
